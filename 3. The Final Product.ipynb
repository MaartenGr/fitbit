    "**The Problem**  \n",
    "In the last few years, wearables have taken the market by storm. They can be found in the form of watches, activity trackers, apps for mobile devices and many more. Fitbit, Apple, TomTom, Garmin, Samsung and many other companies have taken it onto themselves to release the most advanced wearable in the form of a watch that has the best user experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, machine learning (which consists of predicting events, data etc.) is growing in popularity and is being implemented more and more. For example, we can use machine learning to predict how well you're going to run based on what you've eaten in the past and how that affected your running. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to propose something different and that concerns both user experience and hardware issues. A known problem of activity trackers that measure your heart rate is the inconsistencies (and often not measuring) in the measures. This can be due to hairy arms, sweating while working out or using it in the shower. The user may then see that some data is missing, which can be frustrating. Below you can see an example in my data. It shows that there is no heartrate for roughly an hour even though I was wearing the device! I was working out en sweating quite a lot, which may was what caused the difficulties. \n",

    "Moreover, many people deal with a dangerously high heartrate due to certain patterns in their behaviour. Currently, fitbit doesn't tell you anything if your heartrate is too high. You have to figure that out yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**  \n",
    "Here, I'm not proposing a way to accurately measure the heartrate, but a model that can predict the missing values based on information of your heartrate, steps, distance etc. in the past. This will allow users to see a filled graph of the daily heartrate without any missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Companies developing wearables can use the model to improve the user experience. Moreover, predicting heartrate will allow the device to recommendate certain actions to prevent a heartrate that is too high by simply sending an alert. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If a wearable wath that measures heartrate incorrectly measures heartrate (which is difficult to establish) then the algorithm may be used to take the mean of the tracker and the algorithm to increase the measurement. However, this works best if the device can recognize that is has difficulties measuring heartrate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Code**  \n",
    "In order to show you how the algorithm works and what it can do, I have to use some (depending on your background) difficult code. Don't worry, I will explain the general principles and focus mostly on the result.  \n",
